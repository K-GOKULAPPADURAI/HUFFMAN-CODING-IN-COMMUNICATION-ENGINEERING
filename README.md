# HUFFMAN-CODING-IN-COMMUNICATION-ENGINEERING
A Communication Engineering paper's problem solved by python 


Iam started my coding journey by solving the problems which are present in my study syllabus, Like i already uploaded some math problems... as 12 std repository.

First of all i have spend nearly 1 month for this problem solving. Its quote bit challenging to me, but i didnt give up. I tried hard again and again then in the end i got it by my friend subramaniam he found out the simple mistake made by me... after solving and debugging that issue the program got the ability to do the specific work flow massivley. I also want to thank my friend Jayapriyan w wch is there up, But its code complexcity is very high and ineffiecient method too... I written in a brute force method which may take long time period tooo. 

The input must be a probability of floating point with sperated as input to the program...
The input must want to be in the limit of 1 are less than 1 only in the total...
This will be understandable for the students who know about this problem...

sorry i didnt written any commands to code understanding and in the end i too dont know the working and the flow of execution.
I didnt know how i craked until now..

so dont try to read it its too bad and difficult to understand by a student...

Communication engineering is the weird paper i have ever studied its very different compared to other ece papers..
the combination of the diagrams circuts with the frequency modulation etc..... is very uncommon to write and understand by me..
